old stuff below, probably can be deleted, please review them.
---------------------------------------------------------------
//
actual to-do -main
    handle quotes -> double ok, handle single.

    built in commands:
    missing: cd, export, unset
    ok so far: ls, echo, pwd, env, exit, (echo -n doesn't do anything as I see in normal bash, maybe edge cases?)

    piping
    redirection
    other commands such as redirections.

// deleted lines that had no answer needed/were updates /other things I would just say ok to. to keep this readable, and shorter.
//	feel free to delete questions that are solved, or update them given the new info. Let's try to keep this updated and with needed questions/links/info

questions:
	In the sig.c  file:
	- identifier "SIGQUIT" is undefined same goes to SIGQUIT, SIG_IGN.
		Do we need to add something or it is just on my computer? -all works good on campus, possibly your own computer has different macros/values.
		read:
		https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Termination-Signals.html
		https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(IPC)
		Signals are defined in the computer itself, we are using relative the macro. no need to define it.
		SIGQUIT      P1990      Core    Quit from keyboard

	- signal(SIGINT, sig_handle)
		Dont we need an int in the sig_handle call?  	
			not at the moment, since the function is only used for one signal. (int sig, is only SITGINT)
			a better implemenation for the actions may be needed/added later. read additional comment on the file. 


	According to the subject, we should have one global variable for signal, do you know anything about it? 
	I have no clue how that is working. -> yes, I know. will handle later if needed. don't worry, I'll explain it to you once done.
	the subject says we CAN not we SHOULD. "Use *at most one* global variable" nothing says it's mandatory to.

your questions/comments in the init.c files:
	- exit:
		yes, we can check if we can do that, the current one probably only works if the exit typed as first word,
		but I am not sure that correct, we need to research how exit command acts in terminal 
		
		tests results from school computers on behaviour:
		from the few tests run, appears that exit is taken as a command if it's the only command (eg. ls exit works as ls, saying exit is not valid)
		feel free to run more tests. (another eg. echo exit, prints exit) If you put a word that is not a command, does not exit, and says command is not found.

	- pid as struct:
		well, due to pipe I had to change them to structs at the end -> this can be def be done in the tokens to begin with. I was asking you if it's needed.

// pipes and other stuff - this is in the subject. let's try not to make this longer than necessary. We can read the PDF.

we need to create a condition to check if the command line has any of these signs and call different process according to that -> yes, I've been thinking and telling you abt it. 
We can consider different approaches, so I didn't implement it yet. 


// stuff done:
	take_comm was separated to different parts
		- created a new function called process_commands which took over the rest of the take_comm
		- tried to handle pipes, failed, at the end tried to get chatgpt fix it, failed
			for_pipes.c at the moment is not good -> all of it? You may add comments on what are the issues. + feel free to add 
				another file for what comes up with gdb, for example. I can check it myself, but since you're implementing it, 
				it's easier if you do, as I'm not 100% able to understand why you chose some ways to handle things. 

		- builtin.c just a splace where we can do the next parts, not developed yet -> declarations,even if not implemented, pls put in the h file.
			I moved them to h file. 

if something does not work, would be useful if you indicate why.





New comments:
----------------------
17/Apr - Ferenc:
---------------START---------------

edge cases:
- pipe issue due to tokenazation/array
		prompt> ls -a | wc -l
		21
		prompt> ls -a |wc -l
		ls: cannot access '|wc': No such file or directory
	these two should have to the same, so we need to separate '|wc' somewhere in the code. 
	but this may have to be handled on the redirections as well like: echo hello >outfile.txt
	'>outfile.txt' part will be handle the same way
idea:
	create a function which will check the tokens and split those which has | > or other separators 
	this should be done after tokenazation and before we creating the arrays
Update:
new split token functions were added and implemented, tested as well with pipes (redirection needs to be tested once implemented)

Also updated the init.c due to history. Now it should not save command if it started with a single space (same as normal termina).

---------------------

New to-do list here //please update it if something missed:
- Ignore \ and ; in the command line (or prevent something)
- redirections: <, >, <<, >>
- $? - not clue what this but we need to handle it.
- also " and ' needs to be handled some way, which I am not sure we do it as they wish...

In progress stuff //updated if they are actually done
- echo - edges example which I am not sure we need to handle. This maybe something extra and we can skip. (fingers crossed)
	a command like : echo stuff"abcdef" $SHLVL'pizza'
	will be expressed as
	[echo ] -> [stuff] -> ["abcdef"] -> [""] (special tokens will have "" nodes instead of spaces) -> [$SHLVL] -> ['pizza']

	the expander will convert the spaces into "", and remove the spaces at the words
	the parser will remove the "" nodes, and combine the tokens that should be together	

- env - You said you are working on this, so not much comments. Found the following below, mostly for me to understand what they need to be able to handle. 
	 We need to be able to modify the environment using the export and unset commands.
	 We also need to be able to subtitute variable names for by their values if preceded by a dollar sign.
	 This also means handling single and double quotes, which can be quite tricky.

- cd - cd .. /Music goes to Home, when it should not do anything, cd should only have on argument,
		and stay in the same directory if there is no argument or there is more than one

Note:
I think I will start to check the redirections. I am not sure if we need to fix anything else beofe those could work. 
I will see while I am doing.
